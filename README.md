### Hi 
- I have some previous coding experience because, after 8th grade computer science, I was interested and self-learned some Java script and made some small projects and games.
- I wanted to take this class to enhance my skills and see if compsci is something I would like to continue in college.
- Some of my interests are Soccer, track and field, specifically pole vault, and cars.
- My goal for this class is to learn to make more advanced projects than just small games.
