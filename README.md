## Hi I'm Adrian
1. I have some previous coding experience. I have experience with some HTML and Javascript.
2. I wanted to take this class to enhance my skills and see if compsci is something I would like to continue in college.
3. Some of my interests are Soccer, Football, track and field, specifically pole vault, F1, and the engineering of cars :car:.
4. My goal for this class is to learn to make more advanced projects than just small games maybe like an infotainment system for a car.
